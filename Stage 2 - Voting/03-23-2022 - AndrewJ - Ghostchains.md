What will the Boss DAO do?
But 1 legendary ghostchain and if not already proposed spend 6k to sweep floor ghosts.

Why should the Boss DAO do this? 
To save funds when selling from a fee discount, upcoming token drop, gain access to analytics adding potential data for buying opportunities as well as the potential in surge in price. Each ghost receives 0.01% of revenue and legendaries receive a 0.8% discount on selling fees.

What does the DAO stand to gain?
Discounts on sales saving significant Treasury funds. Additional revenue stream from marketplace sales.

How will the treasury be involved?
Treasury will be utilized for full funding, the cheapest legendary is currently 6k

How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?
Until a significantly better marketplace is overcasting the offset in saved funds and gains from sales volume

When should the vote on this proposal be held?
Within the next week. Freeroam is set to be turned on next week.
