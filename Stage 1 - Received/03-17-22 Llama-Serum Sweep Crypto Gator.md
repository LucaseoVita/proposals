**Proposal Summary**

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 12,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Lazy Llama and Serum-X floor. These funds would be split such that 7,000 ADA would be used to purchase Llama NFTs and 5,000 will be used to purchase Serum-X NFTs.

**Proposal Details**

The proposal of sweeping the Llama and Serum-X floor with 12,000 ADA has multiple potential benefits to Boss Dao shareholders including, but not limited to, the following:

 - The diversification of Boss DAOs portfolio. We all are supporters of BCRC and believe in its future, but diversification of an investment portfolio is a key safeguard and in line with best practices. Lazy Llamas is a project with exceptional, high-quality art, a solid roadmap, and well-written Lazy Paper. It has proven to be a top CNFT project since its mint ended in early January 2022.
 - The treasury would grow from the profits obtained from the Serum and Llama anticipated price increases as we approach the next three rounds of Llama mutations over the next few months: T2 (undead Llamas), T1 (robo Llamas), and Mystery Serum mutations.
	
	 - For example, the Lazy Llama floor rose from 300 to 450 ADA just prior to the least rare mutation lab, T3 (Biomutant Llamas), opening on Feb. 27th , 2022. The Serum floor also rose from 200 ADA to 400 ADA during this time. This is approximately a **50%** and **100%** increase in price across Llamas and Serums, respectively.
	 - As such, Boss DAO can vote on selling a portion of the Lazy Llama and/or Serum-X holdings as we approach each mutation opening date to maximize profit.
	
	 - [All time average Llama price, note the increase in price that corresponds to T3 mutation lab opening.](https://cnftanalytics.io/php/searchStats.php/?search=Lazy%20Llamas,&search_type=2,&chart_type=2&time_range=trAllSelector)
	 - [All time average price for Serum-X, note the price increase that corresponds to the opening date of the T3 mutation lab.](https://cnftanalytics.io/php/searchStats.php/?search=Lazy%20Llamas%20Serum-X,&search_type=2,&chart_type=2&time_range=trAllSelector)
 - We would benefit from the BCRC and Lazy Llama collaboration by becoming eligible for “Vox Llama” airdrops. These Vox Llamas will be fully functional with the Boss Planet metaverse.
 
 - Lazy Llamas is a project that has a large, passionate community (over 10k followers on twitter, 6.6k members on discord) who represent a significant investment group that may be more likely to become members during the second mint of Boss DAO following this floor sweep.
	 - Lazy Llamas also have active collaborations in place with ADArealm, BCRC, CardanoVilla, Pastelbuz, and others which will allow Boss DAO to continue to organically expand its recognition in the CNFT space.
	 - Relatedly, the leadership of the Lazy Llamas project is fully doxed with social media profiles linked on the official project website which decreases the likelihood the project will engage in any malpractice and increases the likelihood that they will continue to deliver on their roadmap throughout this fiscal year.
 - Boss DAO would obtain monthly “Lazy Token” airdrops which occur on the 15th of each month and have already started to be traded on Sundaeswap and Muesliswap. These tokens have **_deflationary rate of 50%_** when used and should increase in value overtime. There are also multiple other project specific utility plans for the Lazy Token including customization of your Llama’s name, clothing, and voting when the project completes its development into a DAO.
	 - Boss DAO shareholders would vote on how the community would like to use these tokens.
	 - Boss DAO would also play a major role on how the Lazy Llamas project would move forward by holding a large share of llamas, serums, and tokens. This will increase the influence of Boss DAO as a whole.

Ideally, a vote will be taken on this proposal 3/20/22 which should be **_prior to_** the official announcement of the T2 mutation lab opening and prior to the Vox Llama airdrop.
