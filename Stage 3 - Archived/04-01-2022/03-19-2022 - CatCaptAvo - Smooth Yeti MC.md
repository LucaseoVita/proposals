## Proposal Summary
We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 20,000 ADA of treasury funds to invest in Smooth Yeti Mountain Club. These funds would be used to purchase:
- 50 Floor Yetis…………………………………12,500A     (50 yetis with an avg floor price 250 )
- 2 Top 1k Yeti ……………………………………2,000A
- 1 Built Snowmobile/parts……………1,500A     (or aquiring parts from mint)
- 1 VIP PASS……………………………………………4,000A



## Proposal Details
This proposal will have several short and long benefits: 

**Sweeping 50 floor Yetis**: Accquiring 50 yetis has two fold rewards. The value of the floor yeti has increased from 25 ada mint to 200ada floor with an all-time floor high of 250. Increased value of initial asset. Secondaly, stake to earn yield of $YETI token coming Q3. The purchase of SMYC assets also allow the DAO the ability to mint SnowMobile Parts, costing 100A each. Twos parts. Per wallet Verified. This Mint is for HOLDERS only. 


**Purchase of 1 Top 1k Yeti**: Purpose is that Rarity traits play a role In the amount of token allocation. Not only will the value of the Yeti increase, but it will also bring in additional token revenue. There is also benefits to subsequent mints holding top 1k.

**SnowMobile Parts:** Like BCRC rockets, snowmobilies will provide p2e rewards, staking opportunities, and further yetiverse Utility. Putting together parts will be cheaper if BossDao can secure its Holder Mints.

**The VIP PASS** provides passive income of
	- This pass allows you **1 free NFT in every collection drop**
	- Entered to win special giveaways  
	- Guaranteed a **WL spot in mints**  
	- All 100 Pass holders will split **10% of monthly royalties**
    

SYMC is a metaverse / P2E project, very much in the mould of BCRC. Their roadmap outlines upcoming tokenomics, P2E minigames and Yetiverse launch all before the end of 2022. In addition to this, the community is extremely motivated - the recent slew of twitter Yeti raids is a testament to this fact. Finally, as investors
ourselves, the main factor we consider is the strength of the team behind any potential investment. 

A recent announcement regarding the SYMC Snowmobiles cause the floor price to almost 3X in 48 hours. Snowmobiles are the equivalent of BCRC Spaceships. Three matching parts make one full snowmobile and holding one Yeti + verification is all that is required to be eligible to join the mint queue. The scarce nature of both Yeti's ( only 7500 in existence ) and snowmobile parts ( only 3000 parts will be minted ) make the SYMC ecosystem a solid investment. 

In their short time in the CNFT space, Keeper and Pablo have proven to be among the best up and coming project managers. They have fulfilled promises and over-delivered at ever step of the way while being active and engaged members of the community. Over 1 million in sales on jpg.store since mint ( 20th February - less than a month ago ), under 9% available for purchase on the secondary market and an almost 10X, plus steadily increasing floor price is no small feat. The project is been growing naturally with solid community. As seen on opencnft.io, SYMC currently sitting at Top 5 in 7days sales, and Top 10 in 30day sales.

The Boss DAO shareholders role would be subsequent  votes on how these tokens will be used to increase revenue. This includes LP staking, converting to ADA, or using in Yetiverse to acquire more assets. BossDao shareholders will also vote on the sale of any assets as the value of Yeti portfolio increases. Further considerations, oppoortunnity lies with opening snowmobile SWAP, Yetiverse Land, and loan/rentals for p2e games.


Ideally, the vote for funding 20,000 ADA should be held the week of April 3,2022
