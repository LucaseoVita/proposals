## Proposal Summary
Sweep Chilled Kongs floor prior to their airdrop of 3,888 Magic Mushrooms which will be used to create Magic Kong NFT's. 

**Sweep Chilled Kongs**

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 7,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Chilled Kongs floor and purchase in order to be eligable to receive the 3,888 Magic Mushrooms that will be airdropped at a date TBA in Q2. Each Chilled Kong in a wallet is a chance to recive a Magic Mushroom.  

**Purchase Magic Mushrooms**

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 3,000 ADA to mint as many of the 5,000 Magic Mushrooms that will be sold via WL and to the public. These mushrooms will have high secondary market value and will allow the Boss DAO to transform any Chilled Kongs we have remaining in our wallet that were not airdropped a Magic Mushroom.  


## Proposal Details
First the Boss DAO will sweep the Chilled Kongs floor ASAP utilizing the 7,000 of ADA treasury funds. The Kongs will be held until the Magic Mushroom airdrop is completed. 
In tandem, the Boss DAO will also mint as many Magic Mushrooms with the reamaining 3,000 ADA during the public sale to maximize our Magic Mushroom inventory. 

If we were to say sweep 10 Chilled Kongs, be airdropped 4 Magic Mushrooms and purchase 6 Magic Mushrooms, we would be able to double or inventory and have a total of 10 Chilled Kongs AND 10 Magic Kongs. 
There will also be a chance that the Boss DAO is airdropped a Super Magic Mushrooms that will be extremely rare and valuable. 
From here, the Boss DAO will be able to determine the value of the Magic Mushrooms on the seconday market and if we were to have more Magic Mushrooms than Chilled Kongs, we could in turn sell these Magic Mushrooms for a substanial profit.
Lastly, we will let the Boss DAO vote which Chilled Kongs & Magic Kongs we want to Hold and Sell.

Ideally, this vote should be held ASAP to ensure we sweep as many Chilled Kongs as possible giving us the best odds to qualify for multiple Magic Mushroom airdrops. 

**Magic Mushroom Announcement (Chilled Kongs Discord):**

**When: Q2**

About: 8888 Mushrooms NFTs; every kong will have a chance to go magic.  5000 mushrooms will be sold (WL/Public) + 3888 airdropped! Within all mushs, will be 5-10 Super Magic ones among them.

The chance to get airdropped with a mushroom will be 1 per Kong you have on your wallet. So, even if you have just one Kong, you have good chances to get one! But, obviously, the more Kongs you have, the more chances you get.

Does the new Magic Kong NFT deletes the one from the first collection?
Not at all, you will keep both Kongs, one Chilled Kong and one Magic Kong. 
They will be different as all traits will evolve in a magic way.
