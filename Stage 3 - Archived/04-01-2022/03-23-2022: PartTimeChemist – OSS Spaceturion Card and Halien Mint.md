## Proposal Summary

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 4000 ADA of treasury funds to purchase Spaceturion Cards to invest in the benefits of holding that particular asset before the guaranteed mint of the Haliens in April.

## Proposal Details

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 4000 ADA in total of treasury funds to purchase the Spaceturion Cards and Haliens; in which 2000 ADA will be reserved to secure ten Spaceturion Cards from the floor and 2000 ADA to be reserved to mint the allowed 30 Haliens in April.  The remaining ADA will be returned to the treasury.

The Spaceturion Cards had a mint price of 45 ADA and now the floor is currently around 100 ADA which has already doubled in value within 2 days.  There is a very limited supply on jpeg store due to many holders are here for the project itself and not for flipping for profit which shows true longevity.

Outer Space Society is going to be a registered company and not just a CNFT project.  They plan to develop a Luxury Clothing Brand which uses the Haliens to represent the company and a portion of the royalties will be given back to the Spaceturion Card holders which will add to the Boss DAO treasury.  Further down the "Spacemap", they plan on developing a Space Hub to buy and sell NFTs across multiple blockchains.  Outer Space Society wants to bring in more people to the Cardano Space which in turn will provide Boss DAO with even more exposure.  Even further down the "Spacemap", a mobile PVP game will be launched which will include the Haliens as playable characters.  Boss DAO can have tournaments in the game against members or other Halien holders.  This will bring even more exposure to the DAO, and this is just the beginning.

What is the Spaceturion Card and why is it so important?  This is the access key to everything in Outer Space Society.  The Spaceturion Card has a finite supply of 1,500 and will allow the holder to mint 3 Haliens with each card the holder holds.  By holding the Spaceturion Card, a guaranteed lifetime mint for every mint moving forward.  This will allow the DAO to mint for life at the lowest possible price and continue to keep building the treasury.  The owners of the original Spaceturion Card will also get an upgraded version before the next round of Spaceturion Cards get minted.  This will provide the Boss DAO to have an even more exclusive stake in the project as only so many will ever be given out.  In the future, the card will also offer staking of the Haliens in which will require the Spaceturion Card to have access to the platform.

The aliens are designed to have Hype-Wear, hence the name, Haliens.  They are a representation of what a 3-D CNFTs should be.  The supply is 5,555 for the first version of the Haliens.  With only 1,500 Spaceturion Cards, that means that 4,500 Haliens are reserved for card holders and only 1,055 will be reserved for public sale.  Another perk to look forward to is that the holders of the Spaceturion Card and Haliens will receive exclusive merchandise that can be given to the holders of the DAO. 

This team has proven time and time again that they are here for the long haul.  From listening to the community, not playing by the normal rules of whitelist grinding, community first mindset, and being transparent about all accomplishments and failures.  The team members are moving countries in order to list this project as a company and plan to fully dox themselves on camera.  I am not aware that this has been done before but it shows that they are committed and here for the long term.  The team has plans to spend a substantial portion of the revenue from the Spaceturion Cards to advertise in the upcoming months.

Ideally, the vote should be held as soon as possible since the Original Spaceturion Card will be upgraded before the Haliens mint in April.
