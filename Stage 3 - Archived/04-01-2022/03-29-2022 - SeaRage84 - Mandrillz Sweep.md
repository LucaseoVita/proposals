Proposal Summary

Sweep The Mandrillz
I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 7,500 ADA of treasury funds to purchase aproximately 100 Drillz from the The Mandrillz floor as the project sets to gain momentum with
rodamap releasing April 5th, announcements of collaborations and airdrops, and a massive ongoing growing community.

In addition, 2,500 ADA of treasury funds to buy Drillz from the top 1000 ranked (per CNFT.TOOLS).  No added value/utility has been announced regarding buying up top 1k 
ranked Mandrillz.  The vote will take place prior to their roadmap being updated next week and given the the CNFT community going this route, we are making a calculated
risk in sweeping up these assets.  That being said, even if no additional utility is applied to top rank Drillz they should appreciate and be worth buying and holding 
in the DAO.

Details
First the Boss DAO will purchase Drillz from floor ASAP utilizing the 7,500 of ADA treasury funds, and  2,500 ADA of treasury funds to buy Drillz from the top 1000 ranked. 
The Drillz will be held in the wallet as assets for at least a year as assets appreciate, and will sell after that set date from purchase if voted by community.

Preferably this vote should be held immediately to ensure purchasing as many undervalued Drillz as possible, therefore ensuring the best ROI
